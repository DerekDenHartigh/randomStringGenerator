# Random String Generator

Right now, my random string generator is going to determine how many iterations it takes to create the string "Hello World!" given a upper/lowercase alphabet, space, and ! to randomly choose from.

# Challenges

* I keep hitting the stack limit on Math.Random() - around 15,400

# Stretch Goals

* eventually I'd like to put in a few different hardcoded scenarios as well as allow the user to define the target string and charset.

* ultimately, I think it would be really cool to see the likely astronomical odds of spontanously generating DNA/RNA sequences for viable proteins.

* maybe collect data from the pre-set runs in a db and average them over time for a statistically significant reference.
